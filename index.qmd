## Introduction

I am a 5th year Applied Mathematics student at Cal Poly Pomona. My post baccalaureate academic interests include pursuing a PhD in Statistics and attaining a teaching credential. I plan to explore the fields of Biostatistics, Climate Sciences, and Biology. My professional experiences so far have helped me decide that these industries are ones I want to further my understanding of.
