## Introduction

I am a 4th year Applied Mathematics student at Cal Poly, Pomona. With the degree, I plan to look for work in the field of Biostatistics. My professional experiences so far have helped me decide that this is the industry I know I want to pursue. On top of these professional goals, I plan to attend a postgraduate program in the same field. I hope that this will help me reach further heights in my career.
