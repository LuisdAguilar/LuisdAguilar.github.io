## Introduction

I am currently working towards an Applied Mathematics Bachelors at Cal Poly, Pomona. When I have completed my Bachelors, I want to go into an industry that is closely related to Data Science. My experiences so far have helped me decide that this is the industry I know I want to spend the rest of my life in. During my job, I want to go back and achieve a Masters in Biostatistics.
